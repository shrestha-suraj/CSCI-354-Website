# Car-Dealership

## This Website I created was a part of a Class Final Project.
## The website I created is an online car dealership as much like Amazon or eBay for other products.
## The website is front-end functional and doesnot have backed code yet.
## However, firebase has been used to authenticate users and also get data from firestore.
## You can visit the website demo by clicking the link on the gihub page.

# Technologies Used
## HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Firebase and Firestore
